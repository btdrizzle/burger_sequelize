# SQL and Handlebars Burger App

There is much more than meets the eye with this simple-looking app.  This app connects with a SQL database hosted on Heroku.  The data is retrieved and posted to/from the database via API calls and is rendered with Handlebars.  Interactivity is all defined on the back-end rather than the front with a home-made API just for the APP.  

## Functionality

Simply type a burger name and hit "Add a burger" to add the burger.  The burger will show in the non-devoured burger table with a button option to devour.  Once devoured, the burger will show in the devoured list.
